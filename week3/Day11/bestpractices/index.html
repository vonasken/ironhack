<p>
The Pagani Huayra (Italian pronunciation: [ˈwai̯ra]) is an Italian mid-engined sports car produced by Pagani. Succeeding the company's previous offering, the Zonda, it costs €1,198,000 ($1,314,000), (£910,905). It is named after Huayra-tata, a Quechua wind god.[1][2] The Huayra was named "The Hypercar of the Year 2012" by Top Gear magazine and received a very positive review when tested by Richard Hammond on Top Gear. The Huayra was previously the fastest road car to go around the Top Gear Test Track, setting a time of 1:13.8, beating the previous record of 1:15.1 set by the Ariel Atom V8 in January 2011, but was beaten by the McLaren 675LT in June 2016 that set a record of 1:13.7.

On February 11, 2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra has been sold out. The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG. </p>
